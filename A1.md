# First Application: [MYNTRA]

#### Link to application: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myntra.android&hl=en]

Myntra is an online shopping mobile application that caters to the fashion needs of men, women and kids across apparels, footwear, cosmetics, accessories, home decor and furnishing. Myntra provides trouble free shopping experience to users with widest range of more than 2000 international and national brands [1]. This application is chosen because of the two reasons: Brief to medium length interaction as this application has a drop down menu system (Screenshot 2,3) that is fast and responsive thus helping user in selecting apparels from different categories quickly and Organized Content that is easy to follow in the form of multiple views that avoid overloading user.

This application specifically provides try and buy option (Screenshot 8) that lets user try purchase during delivery and pay only for clothes that one likes and returning the rest at the same time [2]. Fashion experts provide styling tips and recommend clothing styles specific to user, which is cheaper than hiring professional stylists (Screenshot 9).  This application provides free shipping, cash on delivery and interac or credit card payment options on delivery, in case user decides to pay when products arrive on his/her doorstep [3]. Through Refer and Earn option [4], user can refer this application to friends and for every shopping they do, user will earn some credit points. There are also loyalty discounts and group rewards, for example giving additional discounts on already discounted products to group members.

Myntra uses React Native for both iOS and Android applications [5, 6]. It also uses following phone resources: camera, touchscreen, wireless (internet) and photo library. Myntra mobile application is both productive and informative, as it has a task based content of online shopping with multiple views and fashion expert’s styling tips for the user.

Myntra has a unique strength as it uses force touch (tap and hold) to select similar styles of clothing (Screenshot 10,11). However Myntra stores its data locally on phone. It’s a strength as application can work when there is no internet connectivity but at the same time it has a weakness that it consumes almost a gigabyte of data. Regarding improvements in the application, I would like to add image and voice search facility so that old method of adding text to a search box and then using filters on certain categories for locating apparels is avoided. I would also add augmented reality feature so that one can see how one looks in selected apparels before purchasing them. 


### Screenshots:

### First Heuristic Evaluation: [Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors.]

Error messages are displayed every time when form validation fails. It can be seen in the Screenshot 12, that whenever a user tries to enter an invalid email address during sign up, he is presented with an error saying “Please enter a valid email address”.

Error messages are expressed in plain language and appropriate recovery messages are shown to deal with errors. For example in Screenshot 14, when a user tries to add special character in Full Name, a solution is suggested, telling user not to use any special character while writing his/her name. 

### Second Heuristic Evaluation: [Help and documentation]

Help information is provided that lists further steps to be carried out and can be easily searched in categories section as shown in screenshot 15. Context related help is also provided and is easy to follow as can be seen in Screenshot 16. For example during Sign In, if a user forgets a password then he is directed to a different page where he can enter his email and follow subsequent steps to recover the password as shown in Screenshot 17 and 18.
 

# Second Application: [LENSKART]
#### Link to application: [https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/lenskart-online-shopping-app/id970343205?mt=8] 

Lenskart is an online eyewear shopping mobile application that provides wide variety of Eyeglasses, Contact Lenses, Sunglasses and their accessories both for women and men at affordable prices in India
[8] .The primary reason this application is chosen is because it uses augmented reality technology [11] for trying glasses on one’s face. User can upload his image and then checks the eye frame that suits his face. Moreover it also uses drop down menu style (Screenshot 3) that provides brief to medium access interaction with multiple views.

The buy-in for user is, user can book an appointment with expert optician for home or office eye checkup (Screenshot 9) [9]. Apart from that user can purchase rich, latest and authentic collection of designer and premium eyewear at prices much cheaper than anywhere else. Try and buy, cash on delivery, express delivery within 2 days, Refer and Earn and free shipping are other enticing options for users to use this application for eyewear shopping [9]. 

Lenskart uses Ditto’s 3D Virtual Try on service for facial analysis [11] [12]. Apart from this it also uses phone’s resources like camera, touchscreen, internet and photo library. Lenskart uses Augmented Reality [11] and is also a productive mobile application. It has a task based content (of selecting and buying eyewear).

Regarding strengths, this application uses virtual mirror (3D Try) that lets user upload his image using his camera [10] and check how different glasses look on his/her face (Screenshot 6,7,8). It also has a facility of live chat with customer service executive [9] that user can use to get answers to his queries. However application is specifically designed for mobile phones and does not fits well on tablets. Although application can still run on tablet but quality resolution is compromised. One thing that I would like to improve in the application is to make its virtual mirror accessible to most of the smartphones as currently it is limited to only iphones above 6S. Second improvement that I would consider is, to make this application tablet friendly.  

### Screenshots:

### First Heuristic Evaluation: [Help and documentation]

Help information is provided and can be easily searched using account section, as shown in Screenshot 11 .Frequent answering and questioning (FAQ) section provides context dependent help and can be easily followed as can be seen in Screenshot 10 and 12. 

### Second Heuristic Evaluation: [Error Prevention]

It is easy to make errors in the first place. During sign up, error styling to the different text inputs and real time text validation is not provided. User interface for different input text fields should be communicated to the user before sign up validation. Please refer Screenshot 13 and 14.
